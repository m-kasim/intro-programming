0. General:
- [static class]:
- A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference:
a static class cannot be instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new operator to create
a variable of the class type. Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a
static class by using the class name itself

- [sealed]:
When applied to a class, the sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it.

2. The difference between C# and .NET Framework:
- C#:
C# is a high-level general purpose programming language developed by Microsoft Corporation between 1998 and 2002,
which aims to address the weaknesses in C and C++, such as memory management, type handling and also to introduce more functinality
in them, creating a competitor for Java in the developer marketplace.

- .NET Framework:
.NET Framework is a set of libraries, software modules and code written in C# which allows developers in that language to write
applications in C# faster and with better safety and structure.
